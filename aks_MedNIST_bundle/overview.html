<h4>Image Classification Tutorial with the MedNIST Dataset</h4>

<p>Introduction In this tutorial, we introduce an end-to-end training and evaluation example based on the MedNIST dataset. </p>

<p>
You'll go through the following steps:

<ul>
    <li>Get the dataset</li>
    <li>Train the model with a PyTorch program (on your own).</li>
    <li>Evaluate on test dataset during the Test Phase</li>
</ul>


The MedNIST dataset was gathered from several sets from TCIA, the RSNA Bone Age Challenge, and the NIH Chest X-ray dataset.
