Building an evaluation program that works with CodaLab

This example uses python.

evaluate_training.py - will compare a user submitted csv to a ground truth one.
metadata - contains the execution script for evaluate.py plus it's input and output directory.

Once these pieces are assembled they are packaged as <program>.zip which CodaLab can then use to evaluate the submissions for a competition.
